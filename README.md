# 🤖 **Ninja Navigator AI** – Multi-Agent Travel Planning System

## **Problem Statement**

**Travel planning** is complex, time-consuming, and often inefficient when handled manually or via single-agent systems. Users must juggle information from different domains—destinations, weather, budget, scheduling—leading to fragmented or generic plans.

### **Why AI Multi-Agent Systems?**

AI **multi-agent systems** allow for **domain-specific expertise**, parallel processing, and fault tolerance—making them ideal for dynamic, high-context tasks like travel planning. Each agent contributes focused intelligence, and together they produce **faster**, **more personalized**, and **more reliable** travel solutions.

---

## 🚀 **Project Description**

**Ninja Navigator AI** is a multi-agent orchestration system designed to deliver **intelligent, actionable travel plans** based on a user’s natural language query. It harnesses multiple specialized agents that work independently and collaboratively to research, analyze, and generate complete itineraries.

### 🔹 Agent Responsibilities

| Agent                 | Role                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coordinator Agent** | Manages query parsing, agent execution, synthesis, and error fallback        |
| **Research Agent**    | Identifies attractions, culture, safety, local insights                      |
| **Weather Agent**     | Retrieves forecasts, recommends weather-based activities and packing items   |
| **Budget Agent**      | Estimates costs, performs currency conversion, suggests budget optimizations |
| **Itinerary Agent**   | Generates optimized, weather-aware, budget-constrained daily plans           |


### 🧠 How They Work Together

1. **User Input** → Natural language travel query
2. **Coordinator Agent** extracts requirements
3. **All agents execute concurrently** via `asyncio`
4. **Results are aggregated** and passed through a synthesis pipeline
5. **Final travel plan is generated** in structured markdown format, with export options
